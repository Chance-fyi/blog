**Mouse Gestures** is a lightweight browser extension designed to improve your browsing efficiency through intuitive **mouse gestures** and **drag-and-drop operations**.  
It enables faster, smoother web navigation with simple mouse movements.

---

## 🔍 What This Extension Does

- Provides **right-button mouse gestures** to perform common browsing actions
- Supports **drag-and-drop gestures** for text, links, and images
- **Customizable actions**: create and manage your own gestures and choose the actions they perform
- Offers **local backup and restore** for all settings
- Includes an **optional** Google Drive sync feature for cross-device configuration backup

The extension runs fully on the client side and does not change webpage content beyond enabling gesture functionality.

## ☁️ Optional Google Drive Sync (Why OAuth Is Needed)

Google OAuth is required **only when a user chooses** to sync their configuration to Google Drive.

With authorization, the extension can:

- Upload the user's gesture configuration file to **their own Google Drive appDataFolder**
- Restore the configuration from the same private folder
- Access only the files created by the extension

**It cannot view or access any other files in the user's Drive.**

Users may choose to use **local backup only**, without enabling Google Drive sync.

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Data Protection

- The extension does **not collect or send** any personal data to external servers.
- All data remains on the user's device unless they intentionally enable Google Drive backup.
- Google Drive permissions are limited to the extension's private app folder.
- No analytics, no tracking, no ads, and no third-party data sharing.
